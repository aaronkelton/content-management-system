Atomic commits to build a simple content management system via [Kevin Skoglund at Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-5-Essential-Training/500551-2.html). Many thanks to the Dallas Public Library for the free Lynda access, Kirk Keeter for teaching his free Rails and React course, and Dallas Makerspace for the classroom space.
